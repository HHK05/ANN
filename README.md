## 📊 Project Overview

This ANN model analyzes bank customer data to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank or stay. The project aims to achieve the best possible accuracy through careful implementation and optimization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Neural Networks**: Primary machine learning approach.
- **TensorFlow**: Primary framework for building and training neural networks.
- **Apache Spark**: For big data processing (if applicable).
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model evaluation.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Utilizes bank customer data for predictions
- Implements a 3-layer neural network
- Employs consistent activation functions across layers
- Focuses on achieving high prediction accuracy

## 🔢 Model Architecture

The ANN consists of:
- Input Layer
- 2 Hidden Layers
- Output Layer (Binary classification: Stay or Leave)

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Construction
3. Training
4. Evaluation
5. Prediction

## 🎯 Prediction Goal

The final output of the model predicts whether a customer is likely to:
- 🏦 Stay with the bank
- 🚶‍♂️ Leave the bank

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Experiment with different activation functions
- Implement hyperparameter tuning
- Explore ensemble methods for improved accuracy
